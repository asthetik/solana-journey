# Solana Journey

From zero to one — learning Solana in public

---

## 👋 About

This repository documents my journey of learning **Solana** from scratch.

I am currently enrolled in a Solana developer bootcamp and use this repository to
publicly record my learning process, including:

- Learning notes written in my own words
- Experiments and small demos
- Mistakes, pitfalls, and lessons learned
-  Weekly progress and reflections

This is a **learning-in-public** repository.
The code and notes may be imperfect, but they reflect real progress.
